   \sec The main loop over Bible books
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   The \`\processbooks` macro does two loops over all marks in \^`\printedbooks`.
   The macro \`\printedbooks` is a list of `<a-marks>` of Bible books separated by spaces
   and it must be defined in the main file. The `\_useit` trick is used here
   in order we want to add `<space>{}` at the end of the expanded
   \^`\printedbooks`.
   The first loop body sets \`\pbook!``<a-mark>` used for hyperlinks.
   The second loop body does:
   \begitems
   * Defines \`\amark` as <a-mark> (an actual mark of the book used in the text).
   * Defines \`\bmark` as <b-mark> (a mark of the book used in file names).
   * Defines \`\.btit` as the book title.
   * Calls \^`\.newbook{<a-mark>}`
   * Prints title of the book to the terminal and to the log.
   * Calls \^`\bex!<a-mark>` in order to apply the \^`\BookExceptions` data.
   * Inputs introduction file if it exists. The real `\input` and formatin
     of the introduction text is done by the `\.printintro` macro.
   * Inputs format definition file if it exists. Information is saved to the
     \TeX/ memory.
   * Inputs notes file if it exists. The notes are saved to the \TeX/ memory.
   * Calls \^`\bpr!<a-mark>` in order to apply the \^`\BookPre` data.
   * Inputs `txs` file with original text of the Bible using \^`\.bibleinput`,
     i.e.\ prints the text from `txs` file with notes from the \TeX/ memory.
   * Calls \^`\bpo!<a-mark>` in order to apply \^`\BookPost` data.
   \enditems
   Note that the macros \`\introfile`, \`\fmtfile`, and \`\notesfile`
   give the location of aprropriate files and these macros must be defined
   by the user in the main file.\nl
   Note2: each book of the Bible is processed in the group.
   It means that all data from notes, formats etc. are stored
   in the memory only temporary for processing single book. After
   the Book is finalized, the \TeX/ memory is freed.

   \sec Book titles
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

   The macro \`\BookTile` `<a-mark> <b-mark> {<title>}` declares titles
   of each Bible books. The <a-mark> is an actual book mark used in printed text.
   The <b-mark> can be used in file names as \^`\bmark`. 
   The mapping is done here:
   `\def`\`\btit!``<a-mark>{<title>}`, `\def`\`\f!``<a-mark>{<b-mark>}`.

   The macro is defined as `\outer` because we don't want to see obscure
   errors due to missing a space after `<b-mark>` or `<a-mark>`.

   The \`\BookException` `<a-mark> {<code>}` macro adds the <code> to the
   \`\bex!``<a-mark>` macro. It is used in \^`\.processbooks`
   loop in the group before files are read. You can redefine some filenames
   or something more special here.\nl
   Macros \`\BookPre` `<a-mark> {<code>}` and \`\BookPost` `<a-mark> {<code>}`
   are defined similarly. They add <code> to the \`\bpr!``<a-mark>` and to

   \sec Actions
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   We create the output in two steps. First step: the data from `\Note`
   etc.\ are read and saved to the \TeX/ memory. For each such data element the
   \"action" is registered to a list of actions of the given verse. Each
   Bible verse has its list of actions.
   The second step: the Bible verses are read from a `.txs`
   file and all appropriate actions (registered to this verse) are
   processed before the verse text is printed. These actions can modify the
   selected parts of the verse text.\nl
   `\alist!<full-vref>` is the list of actions associated with the verse
   `<full-vref>`. The <full-vref> is full reference to the verse in the format
               <book-mark>/<chapter-num>:<verse-num>\nl
   `\.newaction{<full-vref>}{<action-body>}` allocates new action.

}

   \_doc
   A typical \"action" is `\.replpre`. The actions are processed for each
   Bible verse when the verse text is saved to the `\.buff` macro. The
   `\.buff` macro is processed after all actions of given verse are done.\nl
   `\.replpre{<prefix>}{<text>}{<fail>}` replaces first occurrence of <text>
   by `<prefix>{<text>}` in `\.buff` macro. If the <text> is empty then
   `<prefix>{}` is inserted at the beginning of the `\.buff`.\nl
   If <text> does not exists then <fail> is processed. The <fail>
   macro can use `\.text` where <text> is saved.

   \sec The `\Note` macro
   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   The first parameter of the `\Note` macro is `<gen-vref>`.
   It is generalized reference to the Bible verse. It can be
   `<chapter-num>:<verse>` (the <book-mark> is appended from
   `\CommentedBook` token list) or `<chapter-num>:<verse-from>-<verse-to>`
   (only <verse-from> is used for generating <gen-vref>.\nl
   `\.gentovref{<gen-vref>}` expands to <full-vref>.

   \_doc
   The `<word>` given as a parameter of the `\Note` macro (see bellow) is used as a word
   phrase which should be be searched in the given verse text. This parameter `<word>`
   is transformed first by expansion of `\.transformword{<word>}` to the `<tword>` variant
   and the `<tword>` is actually used for searching. The `\.transformword{<word>}`
   expands to the variant of the <word> declared by `\.vdef`. If not declared then it
   expands to the <word> itself, i.e <tword> is equal to <word> in this case.

   `\Note <gen-vref> <space> {<word>} <text> \par`
   transforms <word> to the <tword> (see above),
   saves <text> and activates replace-action of <tword> to
   `\.doNote{<note-num>}{<tword>}` in given verse. 
   \nl
   There is an alternative syntax 
   `\Note <gen-vref> <space> {<word>}={<pword>} <text> \par`
   If <pword> is given then is is printed in the note instead <tword>.
   More precisely: transformed <word> is used for searching
   (and it is kept in the verse unchanged) but <pword> is
   printed in the note.\nl
   The `\ww` can precede `\Note`. If it is true then the <word> is prepared in
   `\nextww` and `<pword>` is in `\nextwwA`. Otherwise, the macros `\nextww`
   and `\nextwwA` are undefined.\nl
   `\Note` does exactly following:
   \begitems
   * Allocates new <note-num>,
   * Transforms <gen-vref> to <full-vref> using `\.gentovref`.
   * Modifies <full-vref> if `\renum` was declared using `\.renumvref` and
     saves the result to `\.fullvrefm`.
   * Use `\nextww` and `\nextwwA` as <tword> and <pword> if they are defined.
   * Otherwise transforms <word> to <tword> by `\.transformword`.
   * Reads <pword> (word to be printed in the note) if the alternative syntax
     with `={<pword>}` is used. Else <pword> is equal to <tword>. 
   * Defines `\notetext!<note-num>` as <text>.
   * Defines `\noteref!<note-num>` as <full-vref>.
   * Defines `\notepre!<note-num>` as numeric part of modified <full-vref>
     and calculates <from>-<to> part (if exists in <gen-vref>) using `\renumlabel` macro.
     This is printed prefix of the `\Note`.
   * Defines `\pword!<note-num>` as <pword>,

   If the `<to>` part is in the format <chapter>:<verse>

   The `\``Note` text is processed and printed in the second step, when the

   \begtt
   \.replpre{\.doNote{<note-num>}}{<tword>}{\.notefail{<note-num>}}
   \endtt
   It means that the `<tword>` is searched in the verse text and
   replaced by `\.doNote{<note-num>}{<tword>}`.
   If `<tword>` is not found then `\.notefail{<note-num>}` prints warning

   The \code{\<} will be set to active as character equivalent to
   the macro `\.bref<text>>`. This macro does all job with the hyperlinks.
   Fist of all, it scans the parts of the `<text>` and saves them to
   \begitems
   * `\.ltextP` ... the text before a link specification (given in `"..."`)
   * `\.ltextB` ... the book mark followed by `~`
   * `\.ltextC` ... the chapter number followed by `:`
   * `\.ltextV` ... the verse number
   * `\.ltextS` ... sub-verse identifier (`a` if there is a verse `4a`)
   * `\.ltextF` ... the `--` if the `<from>-<to>` format is given
   * `\.ltextN` ... the `<to>` part from the `<from>-<to>` format.
   \enditems
   All these macros above can be empty if the appropriate part of the
   scanned `<text>` is missing.
   The `\.linkpre` macro includes `v` if it is verse link,
   includes `n` if it is note link and `g` if it is gloss link.
   These macros will be converted due to `\renum` data (if needed)
   and printed by `\.linktext`.

   We don't create destinations for all verses, notes etc. but only for
   those which are referenced.
   The macro `\.ensuredest` is called from `\.createlink` and it saves immediatelly
   `\sdef{<link>:<full-vref>}{}`
   to the special file `\jobname.xrf`. And the macro `\pg` saves immediatelly
   `\sdef{pg:<link>:<full-vref>}{??}` to this file.
   This `.xrf` file is read before standard
   `.ref` file. All link destinations save `\.Xdest{<full-vref>}` to the
   `.ref` file. The macro `\.Xdest` does nothing if `\pg:<link>:<full-vref>` is not
   defined (from `.rfx` file). Otherwise, it is defined as a correct pageno.
   This result is used in the `\pg` macro.
   If `\<link>:<full-vref>` is not defined, no link destination is crated.
   First \TeX/ run creates `.ref` and `.xrf` files and does not create any
   hyperlink destinations. Second \TeX/ run uses data from these files
   and create correct hyperlinks and page numbers.

   The `\.noteinsert {<text>}` inserts its parameter to the `\.noteins`.
   We open the `\insert` and set basic parameters using `\.noteset`.
   Then the empty box with strut height is inserted in vertical mode
   (in order to consecutive notes have good baselineskip between them).
   Then the `<text>` is printed and the paragraph is finalized.
   The empty box with strut depth is appended after the paragraph
   (in order to the same reason). Final `\penalty0` allows breaking between
   notes.

   We add macros for inserting two columns of notes from `\.noteins` into the
   page. First, we add `\noterule` with the space given by
   `\skip\.noteins`. The `\.noteins` material is prefixed by `\penalty0` (in
   order to allow the next `\vsplit` operation) and the `\vfil` is added (in order
   to the case when the second column is smaller than the first one).
   The `\splittopskip` is set and first `\vsplit to0pt` adds skip given by
   `\splittopskip` to the `\.noteins`. The `\_balancecolumns` from \OpTeX/
   for splitting to two columns is used. We need to set `\_Ncols`, `\_dimen0`
   and `\_box6` before running `\_balancecolumns`. We need to insert
   `\vskip\splittopskip` because `\_balancecolumns` supposes that the typesetting point
   resides at the first baseline of the columns.\nl
   The final `\vskip` does \"raggedbottom". We need to add `1filll` in order
   to suppress the `\vfill` from the `\end` algorithm. We add `minus6pt`
   because the height of two columns can be by half-line higher than the
   insertion algorithm excepts (in the case with odd lines before
   splitting to the two columns).

   `\putArticle` `<chapter>:<verse> {<title>} [<label>] (<params>)`
   inserts an article given in the file `articles-*.tex` signed by
   `\Article [<label>]`. The article starts at the page where
   <chapter>:<verse> is or at the next page. The article is in two-columns
   style and it is divided to $k$ two-columns parts each of them is inserted
   at the bottom of the next page.

   We calculate the number of pages used for article text by following rules.
   All the two-columns parts have the same height. If there are more than one such
   a part, the height does not exceeds 2/3 of the page. But single two-column part
   can be higher.

   `\putArticle` registers `\doArticle` using `\.newaction`.
   `\doArticle` is run at the beginning of given verse and creates an
   `\botisert`. The insert material is breakable at its beginig and between
   each two-column boxes created by the `\balancecolumn` macro.

   The `\.doArticle` `{<Title>}[<label>](<params>)` inserts the article to one

   page, all collumns of the article is completely balanced.
   First, the whole text is saved to the `\box0`
   with given column size and the number of pages is calculated in `\_tmpnum`.
   Then the number of columns `\_Ncols` is 2 times the number of calculated pages.
   The height of each two-columns part of the article is `\dimen0`.
   Finally we do re-boxing the output of `\_balancecolumns` in order to
   reach individual columns and create pairs of them by `\fornum` loop.
   These pairs are completed to blocks with LightGrey background.
   These blocks divided by `\break` are inserted into `\.botinsert`.

   The following macros `\Cite`, `\insertCite` and `\swapCites` are used for
   insertion of citations to the two-cloumn printed articles.
   The `\Cite``<label>{<text>}` simply saves the <text> to the macro
   `\c!<article-num>!<label>`.
   The `\insertCite``<label><feft-or-right>` inserts the citation declared
   by `\Cite <label>` to the text using `\vadjust`. The variant `\left` and
   `\right` is processed or ignored. This depends on the parity of the

   the \^`\introfile`, prints the title "Introduction" (depending on the
   current language and puts all introduction text between \^`\.begblock`
   and \^`\.endblock`.

   By default, chapter numbers are in the outer margin and quotes characters
   too. 
   The `\normalchapnums` macro moves chater numbers to the left side in the
   first paragraph, cquotes characters are removed and outer margins are
   reduced because there is no material in them.
